# hyper-appimage

Arch package for hyper based on the AppImage.

Based on the existing [upwork-appimage](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/upwork-appimage/).

## Why?

The `hyper` package from AUR installs NPM, Yarn, NodeJS and Electron just to install, which is not
ideal for me as I want to control my own versions of those softwares and not have one package
pollute that.
